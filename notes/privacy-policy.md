# Privacy Policy for PostgresMac

**Last Updated: December 1, 2025**

> **Legal Notice**: This privacy policy is provided as a draft template. It should be reviewed and approved by qualified legal counsel before publication or distribution, especially for Mac App Store compliance.

## Introduction

PostgresMac is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our macOS PostgreSQL client application handles your information. Our fundamental principle is simple: **your data stays on your device**.

PostgresMac is a local-only application. We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal information or usage data. This privacy policy explains what data the app accesses on your device and how it is used.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

PostgresMac does not collect any information from you, including but not limited to:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Device information
- IP addresses or location data
- SQL queries or database content you work with
- Connection credentials or database information

**We do not track you. We do not analyze your behavior. We do not collect any data whatsoever.**

## Information the App Accesses Locally

While PostgresMac does not collect or transmit any data, it does access the following information locally on your device to provide its functionality:

**PostgreSQL Connection Information**
- Database connection credentials (host, port, username, password, database name)
- Saved connection profiles with your chosen names and settings
- Connection parameters you configure

**Database Content**
- The databases, tables, and data you choose to access through the PostgreSQL servers you connect to
- SQL queries you write and execute
- Query results returned from your PostgreSQL servers

**Important**: All of this information remains exclusively on your Mac. It is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## How Your Data is Stored

All data used by PostgresMac is stored locally on your device:

**macOS Keychain Integration**
- Database passwords are securely stored in your macOS Keychain
- This is Apple's built-in secure storage system designed to protect sensitive credentials
- Only PostgresMac can access these stored passwords, and only with your system's permission
- Passwords are encrypted and protected by your Mac's security features

**Local Application Storage**
- Connection profiles (excluding passwords) are stored in your application's local storage
- This includes connection names, hostnames, ports, usernames, and database names
- All data is stored using standard macOS application data storage
- No data is synchronized to iCloud or any cloud service

**SQL Queries and Results**
- SQL queries you write are executed directly against the PostgreSQL servers you specify
- Query results are displayed in the app but not permanently stored
- No history of your queries or results is maintained by the application

## Data Security

Your data security is ensured through:

**Local-Only Architecture**
- PostgresMac operates entirely on your device
- No data transmission to external servers (except PostgreSQL servers you explicitly connect to)
- No network connections initiated by the app except to your specified database servers

**macOS Security Features**
- Leverages macOS Keychain for credential security
- Uses standard macOS application sandboxing and security features
- Protected by your Mac's security settings and user permissions

**Direct Database Connections**
- When you connect to a PostgreSQL server, the connection goes directly from your Mac to that server
- We are not an intermediary in this connection
- All communication follows the standard PostgreSQL protocol with its security features

## Third-Party Services

PostgresMac does not use any third-party services, including:

- Analytics platforms (no Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Crash reporting services
- Advertising networks
- Cloud storage services
- Authentication services

The only network connections made by PostgresMac are directly to the PostgreSQL database servers you explicitly configure and choose to connect to.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data. Your database credentials, connection information, SQL queries, and results never leave your device (except when sent directly to your PostgreSQL servers as part of normal database operations).

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

**Deleting Connection Profiles**
- You can delete any saved connection profile directly in the app
- Deleting a connection removes it from local storage

**Removing Passwords**
- Deleting a connection profile also removes associated passwords from macOS Keychain
- You can also manage stored passwords through macOS System Preferences > Passwords

**Uninstalling the App**
- Uninstalling PostgresMac removes the application and its local data
- You may need to manually remove Keychain entries through System Preferences if desired
- No data remains on our servers because no data was ever sent to us

## Children's Privacy

PostgresMac does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app does not target children specifically, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since no data is collected by the app, COPPA compliance is maintained by default.

## Mac App Store Privacy

For Mac App Store users, PostgresMac's privacy label indicates "No Data Collected" because the app does not collect any data that leaves your device. The app accesses local data only as necessary to provide database management functionality.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, legal requirements, or our privacy practices. When we make changes:

- The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised
- If distributed through the Mac App Store, updates will be noted in release notes
- For significant changes, we will provide notice through the app or our website
- Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.

## Future Changes to the App

Currently, PostgresMac is a completely local application with no data collection. If we ever introduce features that involve data collection, cloud synchronization, or online services:

- This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly
- Users will be clearly notified before any such features are enabled
- Any data collection features will be optional and require explicit user consent
- The core principle of privacy protection will remain central to the app

## Summary

To summarize PostgresMac's approach to privacy:

- **No data collection**: We do not collect any information from you
- **Local storage only**: All data stays on your Mac
- **Secure credentials**: Passwords protected by macOS Keychain
- **No tracking**: No analytics, no crash reports, no usage statistics
- **No third parties**: No external services or data sharing
- **You are in control**: Complete control over your connection profiles and data

Your privacy is not just a priority—it's guaranteed by our architecture. Since we don't collect your data, we can't lose it, misuse it, or share it. That's privacy by design.
